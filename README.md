# Asteroids

Code for [Boot.dev] course on building Asteroids with Python using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/).

## Start

Install and activate virtual environment using Python version 3.11 which seems to be the highest version Pygame is currently supporting.

```sh
$ python3.11 -m venv venv

$ source venv/bin/activate

$ python main.py
```
