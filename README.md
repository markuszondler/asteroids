# Asteroids

[Build Asteroids](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python)

### What will you learn?

Build a clone of the classic Asteroids game using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) and object-oriented programming concepts. This guided project will help you understand how to use Pygame to create a game loop, handle user input, and manage game state. You'll also learn how to use object-oriented programming to create game objects and manage their interactions.

## Start

Install and activate virtual environment using Python version 3.11 which seems to be the highest version Pygame is currently supporting.

```sh
$ python3.11 -m venv venv

$ source venv/bin/activate

$ python main.py
```
